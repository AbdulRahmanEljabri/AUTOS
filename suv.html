    <p>As before the SVR uses JLR’s supercharged 5-litre V8, and in this application it develops identical power and torque figures to the Jaguar XJR 575 - 567bhp and 517lb ft of torque. For comparison, the previous SVR managed 542bhp and 502lb ft, so the increase is subtle, but welcome all the same.</P>

    <p>An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard and naturally, power is sent to all four wheels - 21-inch rims are standard, with a 22-inch design optionally available. Braking is by 380mm ventilated discs up front and 365mm ventilated discs astern.</P>
