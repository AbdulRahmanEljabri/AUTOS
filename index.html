<div>
    <p>In the world of high-performance cars, the Mercedes-AMG C63S is one of the best on sale in any class. The AMG badge is synonymous with devastating straight-line paceIt delivers rear-wheel-drive handling that will put a grin on any driver's face, and that applies whether you're piloting the saloon, estate, coupe or even the convertible as they are all powered by the same muscular engine.</p>
    
    <p>The C63S has a number of rivals. The coupe is the sportiest option, and has opponents in the shape of the BMW M4 Coupe, Audi RS 5 Coupe, Lexus RC F, Alpina B4 and even the Nissan GT-R. The saloon takes on the BMW M3 , Alfa Romeo Quadrifoglio, Audi RS5 Sportback and Alpina B3, while the C63 Estate challenges the Audi RS4 Avant and Alpina B3 Touring. The C63 S Cabriolet has rivals in the shape of the BMW M4 Convertible and Alpina B4 Convertible.</p>

<h3>BMW M5</h3>

    <p>You come into contact with the BMW M5, you’re in the company of a legend. The Munich-based firm’s M-for-Motorsport division has been crafting fabled performance versions of BMW’s sporty executive saloon since 1986. The line started with a modified six-cylinder engine from BMW’s M1 supercar grafted into a 535i model, and won instant kudos as the fastest saloon car in production in its day. There have been M5 performance versions of subsequent 5 Series generations right up to the present day, and while enthusiasts have their individual favourites, each version has raised the bar further in terms of performance and luxury.</p>

    <p>The BMW M5 is powered by a 4.4-litre V8 engine that features twin turbos and backs up its 592bhp with a mighty 750Nm of torque. With the help of its rapid-fire eight-speed automatic gearbox and four-wheel drive traction the M5 screams to 62mph in the mind-blowingly quick time of 3.4 seconds. Top speed is 155mph, but choose the M Driver package and BMW will override the engine limiter giving you a top speed of 190mph. Selecting the Competition pack barely affects performance, but it does shave a tenth of the 0-62mph time – down to 3.3 seconds.</p>

<h4>AUDI RS7</h4>

</div>
<div>

    <p>In 2016 Audi introduced the RS 7 Performance. This gave the car an extra 45bhp, while 21-inch alloys, privacy glass, a titanium grey styling pack and sports exhaust helped distinguish it from the standard car. As standard, the RS7 Sportback was a little under £87,000 and cam with a 552bhp 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8.There were 20-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights, MMI Navigation plus, RS Super Sports front seats, a powered tailgate and an electric slide and tilt glass sunroof. </p>

    <p>As the RS 7 Sportback is a bit of a unique machine, there aren't really any direct rivals. The closest will be the Porsche Panamera, but while that car will be more driver-focused, the RS 7 is far better looking. You could consider its RS 6 stablemate, ot there's the Mercedes-AMG options of the E 63 and CLS 63.</p>
