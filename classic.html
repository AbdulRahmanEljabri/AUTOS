    <h4>1963 FERRARI 250 GTO</h4>

    <p>Owing to its GTO heritage, this car was a homologation to the legendary 250 series. It looked the part and like any good classic Ferrari it is very rare and very desirable. If you thought the others on this list were valuable then the 250GTO is the Godfather of valuable vintage cars. Less than 39 of these were made and I think less than 10 exist today which is why one sold for almost $55 million in 2013. This worth of this single car is almost the same as the rest of this list combined! It is undeniably pretty. Giotto Bizzarrini is credited with drawing up the design for this masterpiece.</p>
